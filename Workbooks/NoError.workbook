Let’s do something bad.

```csharp
class Manager : Person {
    public string Position { get; set; } 
}
```

Ok, this is expected. Let’s continue normally.

```csharp
var hello = "Hello";
var world = "World";
$"{hello} {world}"
```

Where is my `Hello World` ? Where is an error that the previous error affects this code?
